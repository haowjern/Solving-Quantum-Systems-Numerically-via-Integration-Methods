# Solving-Quantum-Systems-Numerically-via-Integration-Methods
This is a project part of my 3rd Year Computational Physics module, where we studied Numerical Methods. In this project, numerical integration was performed for an exponential gaussian function using methods - Trapezoidal & Simpson’s rules, Monte Carlo methods with ﬂat and important sampling. Monte Carlo with adaptive sampling was also attempted but not fully successful in its implementation. This project has heavy emphasis on correct implementation, speed of implementation, and error analysis. 

Code runs in Python 3.6 Version

1. Run "trap_simp_with_results", for the Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rules, it should run pretty much instantly and give the results that are needed.
2. Run "monte_carlo_results", it uses the module "monte_carlo_integration" and runs for Flat and Importance Sampling. It might take some time to run everything though. It took 
about 1-2 minutes to run on my computer.
3. Run "monte_carlo_with_adaptive_with_results", for the monte carlo with adaptive sampling method. It might take a while to run as well, taking about 1-2 minutes on my computer.
4. In general the code should be self commented, and refer to the report for general discussion of the methods.
5. Results are all within the code, so all that is needed is to run the files.
