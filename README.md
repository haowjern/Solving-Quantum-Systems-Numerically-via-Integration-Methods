# Solving-Quantum-Systems-Numerically-via-Integration-Methods
This is a project part of my 3rd Year Computational Physics module, where we studied Numerical Methods. Methods explored are -  Trapezoidal &amp; Simpson’s rules, Monte Carlo methods with ﬂat and important sampling. Monte Carlo with adaptive sampling was attempted but not successful in its implementation.
